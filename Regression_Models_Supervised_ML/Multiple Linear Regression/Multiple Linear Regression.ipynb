    "# Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "It is Basically the extended version of Simple Linear Regression and the key diffrence in it is that it can predict the values of many explanatory variable.\n",

    "### Explaining Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple linear regression is a function that allows an analyst or statistician to make predictions about one variable based on the information that is known about another variable. Linear regression can only be used when one has two continuous variables—an independent variable and a dependent variable. The independent variable is the parameter that is used to calculate the dependent variable or outcome. A multiple regression model extends to several explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple regression model is based on the following assumptions:\n",
    "```\n",
    " There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    " The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    " yi observations are selected independently and randomly from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    " Residuals should be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance σ.\n",
    "```\n",
    "R-squared is the coefficient of determination And remeber that R-sq can only be between 0 and 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses of MLR :-\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is mostly implemented in predicting market values of the product as it will plot the n no.of varibles on the graph and now we can distinguish whivh factor is affecting the prices most .. and based on that we can earn profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Difference Between Linear and Multiple Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear (OLS) regression compares the response of a dependent variable given a change in some explanatory variable. However, it is rare that a dependent variable is explained by only one variable. In this case, an analyst uses multiple regression, which attempts to explain a dependent variable using more than one independent variable. Multiple regressions can be linear and nonlinear."
