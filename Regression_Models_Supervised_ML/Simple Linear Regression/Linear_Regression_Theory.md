# Linear Regression

The idea of Regression is started by Francis Galton in 1800's. In regression analysis a straight line is best fitted into the training data which creates a hypothesis.. then we input the testing data to test out the accuracy of the model we have tarined.

## What is Regresssion ?

Regression is the measure of the mean value of one variable and the corresponding value of the other variable. It is a way of finding the relationship between a Independent variable and a Dependent variable.Our main goal is to find out 
the best fit line from the given data and then testing it on the rest of the test data this process defines the accuracy of the model trained.

It can be performed with various different approaches like :

1. Least Square Method.
2. Gradient Descent Algorithm.

The most common way of doing linear regression is least square method but it is not that efficient for constructing best fit line while gradient descent outperforms in this situation as this is an optimisaton algorithm.
